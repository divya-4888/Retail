# Retail
A retail giant needs to plan its new store openings over the next 12-18 months and has multiple locations where the stores can be opened. It wants to understand which locations would be the best to open new stores in terms of market size and potential revenues.
Relevant data regarding locations, population, sales, and revenues of key products for stores opened in the past was provided to be analyzed and for model building. 
â€¢	Solution: Created a Random Forest and Logistic regression model to predict if a store should be opened or not in that particular location. Random Forest worked out to be a better model and 23 locations were selected to open new stores based on this analysis.
